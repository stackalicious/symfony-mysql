{"name":"Vagrant-env","tagline":"","body":"Vagrant Development Environment\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis project simplifies the process of web development by creating a simple server environment with apache2, mysql-server, and php.\r\n\r\nThis projects assumes you have already installed the following:\r\n* git (http://git-scm.com/downloads) (ex: v1.8.4.3)\r\n* VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (ex: v4.3.2)\r\n* vagrant (http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) (ex: v1.3.5)\r\n\r\nNote: On Windows when installing Git it is recommended that you select the option to include the bin directory in your path to use the vagrant ssh command.  Otherwise you can use a differt ssh client such as PuTTY.\r\n\r\nNow add a few plugins to your vagrant environment from the commandline:\r\n* `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest` Ensures that the \"guest additions\" on the guest os is up to date. \r\n* `vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus` Installs ruby and chef on the guest os allowing the vagrant script to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nStackalicious Vagrant environment contains a 'sites' directory where you can provide your own website files to be hosted in the virtual environment.  As an example the following instructions will install a simple website called campapp.\r\n\r\n> cd vagrant-lamp/sites  \r\n> git clone git@github.com:dnielsen/campapp.git  \r\n> cd ..  \r\n> vagrant up  \r\n\r\nOnce complete you will have a complete webserver hosting your sample website.  \r\n\r\nQ: How do I see the webpage  \r\nA: Open your web browser and type '192.168.56.3' for the url.  This is the static ip assigned to the vm from Vagrantfile.  \r\n\r\nQ: Can I directly access the virtual machine?  \r\nA: Graphical access is not enabled. To access from the command line type `vagrant ssh` from the vagrant-lamp directory. For Windows you may need to use PuTTY if ssh is not accessible from the command line, see note above.\r\n\r\nQ: How is the server configured?  \r\nA: The Vagrantfile script defines memory and operating system parameters.  The `setup_env.sh` is used to install and configure primary applications: apache, php and mysql.  Finally sites are expected to have a `setup_app.sh` which configures the apache virtual host and populates the database in the  campapp example.\r\n\r\nQ: How can I make changes to the site?  \r\nA: You can change the website directly from the sites folder and refresh the browser to see the results.\r\n\r\nQ: How do I shutdown/restart/startover the virtual machine in case things go wrong?  \r\nA: `vagrant halt` / `vagrant reload` / `vagrant destroy`  Also if you want to rerun the script use `vagrant provison`.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
